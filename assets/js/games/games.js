    Buy new buildings
    As your city grows its numbers, it becomes more challenging to create advanced buildings. Especially when it comes to finding space. To overcome this challenge, you can earn jokers. Use the jokers to purchase the structures you need. It’s best to save these until later when you’ll need them the most.
    
    Track your rank
    At the end of each game, you’re rewarded with a score and a global rank for the size of your city. Keep coming back and building new cities to improve your score! The game will save your progress automatically.
